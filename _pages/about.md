I am a Mathematics PhD student at [ETH Zurich](https://ethz.ch), working on Non-Linear and Integer Optimization, under the supervision of Prof. [Robert Weismantel](https://math.ethz.ch/ifor/groups/weismantel_group/robert-weismantel.html).

I completed my Masters in Mathematics at ETH Zurich in March 2025, focusing in Mathematical Optimization, Operations Research, Graph Theory and Theoretical Computer Science.
