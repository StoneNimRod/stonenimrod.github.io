I am a Mathematics PhD student at [ETH Zurich](https://ethz.ch) under the supervision of Prof. [Robert Weismantel](https://math.ethz.ch/ifor/groups/weismantel_group/robert-weismantel.html).

My research focuses on mathematical optimization, operations research, and their applications. Currently, I am working on a particular class of nonlinear integer optimization problems, in which the constraint matrix has a totally unimodular (TU) structure.

I completed my Masters in Mathematics at ETH Zurich in March 2025, focusing in Mathematical Optimization, Operations Research, Graph Theory and Theoretical Computer Science.

You can reach me by email at *firstname.lastname[at]ifor.math.ethz.ch* or visit me in my office at [HG](https://ethz.ch/en/utils/location.html?building=HG) [G 21.3](https://ethz.ch/en/utils/location.html?building=HG&floor=G&room=21.3).
